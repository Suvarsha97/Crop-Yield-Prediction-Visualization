# Crop-Yield-Prediction-Visualization
Developed a data-driven system to forecast crop yields based on historical agricultural data, rainfall, fertilizer, and pesticide usage. Implemented machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Linear Regression) for prediction and used GeoJSON-based choropleth maps in Plotly to visualize rainfallâ€“yield patterns across Indian states.
