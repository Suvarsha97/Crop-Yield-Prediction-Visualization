Crop Yield Prediction & Visualization using Machine Learning
This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict crop yield based on historical agricultural data, rainfall, fertilizer, and pesticide usage. The goal is to assist farmers, policymakers, and researchers in making data-driven decisions for better agricultural planning.

Objectives:

Predict crop yield using historical climate and agricultural data.

Provide visual insights into rainfall and yield trends across Indian states.

Support policymakers and farmers with accurate forecasts for resource optimization.

Architecture:

Models Used: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost

Visualization: GeoJSON-based interactive choropleth maps with Plotly

Frameworks:
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Plotly

Key Features:

Data preprocessing and feature engineering for rainfall, pesticides, and fertilizers

Machine learning model training and evaluation with metrics like R¬≤ and RMSE

Interactive rainfall‚Äìyield visualization across Indian states

Comparative analysis of multiple algorithms for best accuracy

Results:

Achieved R¬≤ ‚âà 0.85 on yield prediction

Random Forest provided the most reliable performance across datasets

Effective visualization enabled clear interpretation of regional yield patterns

üìÅ Dataset Source: Kaggle Crop Yield Dataset (includes rainfall, fertilizer, pesticide, and yield data across multiple states)
